# Contributing #

Contributions are welcome, providing they are small and focused (and
thus can be code reviewed relatively easily).

Please remember to update the contributors section in the README.md
with your name as part of your first commit to the project.

Any contributions submitted will be tri-licensed, under the supplied
CC0, MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses.

Should you be unable or unwilling to comply with the tri-licensing
condition above, we are unable to accept your code for the project.
This particularly applies to code that has previously been licensed
with an incompatible license (just the Apache 2.0 license, just the MIT
license, any GPL license, etc).

Please do not submit code that has already been licensed with an
incompatible license.
